# Mable MarketPlace Project

Mable MarketPlace is an artificial online retailer that operates in South Africa and has recently started doing business internationally. This project explores seasonal trends of Mable's sales data and historic customer information, and uses regression techniques to build a model to predict the sales of a client. The model is then used to intepret which factors are related to and drive Sales. 

This project uses Python tools/libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikitlearn, seaborn, and matplotlib, and runs on Jupyter Notebook.

Future Improvements:
- Automate EDA pipeline
- Separate data, EDA, and model building for more structure inside repo
- Attempt Lasso instead of linear regression, due to high dimensional dummy data
